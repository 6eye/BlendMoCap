# BlendMoCap by AO

BlendMoCap is a Blender Addon designed to allow the use of BVH data in real animations.  This project was started due to the out-of-date addon that ships with blender, which doesn't appear to have worked correctly for some time.

This project is currently under active developement and should not be considered stable.  Check back for more updates.

## Use

Simply download the .py file, go to User Preferences in Blender, go to the Addons tab, and 'Install from File'.
